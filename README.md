## React JS Uno
![logo](/src/img/uno.png)

Here is the first version of my **React JS UNO project** where I implemented the basic functionality of the famous game.

I am not a designer and all the cards in this game were drawn by css only, so don't judge UI strictly. 
By now you manage all three players by hand, but I am making a plan to automate the process and make playing with the computer possible.

If you face an issue or notice an error, I would like to hear about it.

###### What has been done so far:

- [x] Main game functions
- [x] Game log
- [ ] Complete "say Uno" component
- [ ] Automate gameplay for two players
- [ ] Add the ability to use your name and implement the table
