## React JS Uno
![logo](/src/img/uno.png)

Here is the first version of my **React JS UNO project** where I implemented the basic functionality of the famous game.

I am not a designer and all the cards in this game were drawn by css only, so don't judge UI strictly. 
By now you manage all three players by hand, but I am making a plan to automate the process and make playing with the computer possible.

If you face an issue or notice an error, I would like to hear about it.

###### What has been done so far:

- [x]# Main game functions
- [x] Game log
- [ ] Complete "say Uno" component
- [ ] Automate gameplay for two players
- [ ] Add the ability to use your name and implement the table

## Action Card Description

**+2** - (Draw Two) – When a person places this card, the next player will have to pick up two cards and forfeit his/her turn.

**R** - (Reverse) – If going clockwise, switch to counterclockwise or vice versa.

**S** - (Skip) – When a player places this card, the next player has to skip their turn

**W** - (Wild) - This card represents all four colors, and can be placed on any card. The player has to state which color it will represent for the next player.

**+4*** - (Wild Draw Four) – just like the wild card except that the next player also has to draw four cards as well as forfeit his/her turn
