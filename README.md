# UNO GAME

Here is the first version of my React JS UNO project where I implemented the basic functionality of the famous game.

I am not a designer and all the cards in this game were drawn by css only, so don't judge UI strictly. By now you manage all three players by hand, but I am making a plan to automate the process and make playing with the computer possible.

If you face an issue or notice an error, I would like to hear about it.
